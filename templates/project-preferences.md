# Project Preferences

Developer preferences for how code is written in this project. Captured during discovery, updated as preferences evolve. Every session should read this before writing code.

## Language & Runtime

- **Language**:
- **Version**:
- **Package manager**:

## Code Style

- **Naming**: (e.g., snake_case functions, PascalCase classes)
- **Formatting**: (e.g., black, prettier, gofmt)
- **Linting**: (e.g., ruff, eslint)
- **Type annotations**: (e.g., required, preferred, not used)
- **Imports**: (e.g., absolute, grouped by stdlib/third-party/local)

## Testing

- **Framework**: (e.g., pytest, vitest, go test)
- **Style**: (e.g., descriptive names, AAA pattern, table-driven)
- **Coverage expectations**: (e.g., happy path + error cases, comprehensive edge cases)
- **Testing strategies**: (e.g., property-based (hypothesis), property-based (proptest), contract testing, not applicable)
- **Test location**: (e.g., tests/ mirror of src/, colocated, __tests__/)
- **Parallelization**: (e.g., pytest-xdist with --dist loadgroup, vitest threads)

## Architecture Patterns

- **Data modeling**: (e.g., Pydantic v2, TypeScript interfaces, Go structs)
- **Error handling**: (e.g., exceptions, Result types, error codes)
- **Async**: (e.g., async/await throughout, sync unless needed)
- **File organization**: (e.g., feature folders, layer folders, flat)

## Tooling

- **Key libraries**: (list anything non-obvious that new sessions should know about)
- **Dev commands**: (e.g., `pytest tests/`, `npm run dev`, `cargo test`)

## Workflow

- **Branching**: feature-branches (default: feature-branches — create a branch for medium+ work, direct commits to protected branches only for trivial fixes; set to "direct" for solo projects where committing to main is OK)
- **Protected branches**: main, develop (branches that should not receive direct commits unless branching is "direct")
- **PR creation**: wait_for_user (default: wait_for_user — only create PRs when explicitly asked; set to "automatic" to create PRs after Critic review passes)
- **PR merge**: wait_for_user (default: wait_for_user — present the PR for user review before merging; set to "automatic" to merge after CI passes and review is clean)

---

**What belongs here**: How you want code written. Conventions, tools, style preferences, workflow preferences.

**What doesn't belong here**: What to build (product-brief), system design (data-model, architecture), performance targets (nonfunctional-requirements), or deployment (operational-spec).

## Enforcement

Each preference above should be enforced by one of three mechanisms — assign the mechanism when you add the preference so it doesn't quietly become aspirational.

| Mechanism | Where it lives | What it catches | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Linter** | Project's configured linter (ruff, eslint, swiftlint, etc.) | Mechanical style/naming rules | Best tool when configured. If no linter, preferences in this category fall through to Critic. |
| **Test** | `tests/preferences/test_*.py` (or equivalent) | Structural rules with named exceptions (AST checks, config-presence checks) | Bakes the rule into CI; refuses to be silent. Cost: re-validate when the rule's shape changes. |
| **Critic** | `/critic` review (Goal 4: Project Preferences) | Judgment-required rules (semantic naming, "appropriate" anything, what counts as a "boundary") | No false-confidence test. Cost: requires reviewer per chunk; misses violations between reviews. |

| Preference | Mechanism | Enforcement artifact |
|---|---|---|
| *(fill in as preferences are captured)* | | |

**Rule for adding a new preference:** assign a mechanism. If the preference can be expressed as "every file/function/config matches pattern X with named exceptions" → write a test. If a linter rule already exists for it → configure the linter. If it requires understanding intent → assign to Critic. Never leave a preference unassigned.

**False-confidence guardrail:** if a generated test would pass on conforming code but couldn't reliably catch a real violation (e.g., greppy heuristics for semantic rules), prefer Critic over a weak test. A green test that doesn't actually check the rule is worse than no test.
