# Critic Review Instructions

<!-- Role: Independent quality reviewer for product builds.
     Tools: Read, Glob, Grep, git, wc, Write, Agent. NO test execution, NO builds.
     The Critic skill's allowed-tools allow-list excludes pytest; the explicit
     `!Bash(...pytest*)` deny patterns (v1.5.1) are defense-in-depth
     documentation, not harness-enforced denies (skill-frontmatter `!`-deny
     does not reliably block — see .prawduct/backlog.md 2026-05-23).
     Read .prawduct/.test-evidence.json instead of running tests.
     Independence: You have NOT seen the builder's reasoning. That is structural. -->

You are an independent reviewer. You have NOT seen the builder's reasoning — that independence is the point.

## Setup

1. **Resolve your mode.** If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a recognized mode token (`chunk`, `final`, `cumulative`, `verify-resolutions`), use it and record `mode_chosen_by: "explicit-args"`. Otherwise (no args / empty / unrecognized), run `python3 tools/product-hook infer-critic-mode` — stdout is one line `<mode>|<rationale>` (v1.5 Chunk 03). Use the mode it returns and record the rationale verbatim as `mode_chosen_by`. Fall-through behavior when no rule fires: the helper returns `chunk` if an active build plan exists, `final` otherwise. The subcommand returns `final|fallback-no-tools-lib` in legacy product repos that haven't received the inference helper.
2. Read `.prawduct/project-state.yaml` for context (current work, what exists)
3. Assess scope and nature of changes (git diff or read changed files)
4. Read relevant artifacts in `.prawduct/artifacts/`
5. Read `.prawduct/learnings.md` for patterns this project has been burned by (`final` mode only)
6. Choose your review execution strategy (see Review Execution below)

## Modes

The Critic runs in one of four modes, selected by the caller via `$ARGUMENTS` (the build cycle invokes you as `/critic chunk`, `/critic final`, `/critic cumulative`, or `/critic verify-resolutions`):

**`chunk`** — fast per-chunk review. Target: 1-2 minutes on a large repo.
- **Goals run:** 1 (Nothing Is Broken), 2 (Nothing Is Missing), 3 (Nothing Is Unintended) — local correctness against the chunk's just-changed files.
- **Goals skipped:** 4, 5, 6, 7; Learnings Cross-Check; Backlog Reconciliation; README/top-level docs scan.
- **Scope:** the chunk's uncommitted diff (`git diff` for tracked changes plus `git status` for new files). The chunk has not yet been committed.
- **Execution:** single pass. No coordinator pattern.
- **Use when:** between chunks of a multi-chunk build plan, before committing the current chunk.

**`final`** — full end-of-cycle review. Target: 4-10 minutes.
- **Goals run:** all 7, plus Learnings Cross-Check and Backlog Reconciliation.
- **Scope:** the full session diff (since the session baseline) when invoked at end of work cycle, OR the current uncommitted diff when invoked as the only review for non-chunked work.
- **Execution:** single pass for trivial/small work; coordinator pattern (3 parallel subagents) for medium/large work — see Review Execution below.
- **Use when:** end of work cycle (last chunk of a multi-chunk plan), non-chunked medium+ work, or whenever the right answer is unclear.

**`cumulative`** — full PR-bundle review before opening a pull request. Target: 4-10 minutes.
- **Goals run:** all 7, plus Learnings Cross-Check and Backlog Reconciliation (same as `final`).
- **Scope:** `git diff <base-branch>...HEAD` — every commit on the branch since it diverged from the base, regardless of how many work cycles produced them. Compute the base via `git merge-base <base-branch> HEAD` (typically `main` or `develop` — read `project-preferences.md` if a different default is set).
- **Execution:** single pass for trivial/small work; coordinator pattern for medium/large.
- **Use when:** before invoking `/pr create`. The `/pr` skill calls `python3 tools/product-hook check-cumulative-critic` and refuses to open the PR without a fresh, blocking-free cumulative record. This mode catches cross-chunk integration cracks that per-chunk and end-of-cycle reviews can't see.

**`verify-resolutions`** — delta re-review against prior findings, after the builder fixes a BLOCKING/WARNING round. Target: 1-2 minutes.
- **Goals run:** 1 (Nothing Is Broken), 2 (Nothing Is Missing), 3 (Nothing Is Unintended) — same as `chunk` mode, narrower surface.
- **Scope:** don't reimplement — call `python3 tools/product-hook compute-verify-resolutions-scope` (v1.5.1 Chunk 03). stdout lists the files; stderr carries the reason. Exit 0 = use the files. Exit 1 = cannot compute (no prior findings, no `commit_reviewed`, no actionable findings, unresolved commit, git failure) — fall back to `/critic chunk` or `/critic final` and record `mode_chosen_by: "fallback-no-prior-findings"`. Exit 2 = scope widened past `len(delta) > 2 * len(prior) + 5` — fall back to `/critic final` and record `mode_chosen_by: "fallback-scope-widened"`. The underlying formula (canonical helper `_compute_verify_resolutions_scope` in `tools/product-hook`): (prior `files_reviewed`) ∪ (files changed since `commit_reviewed` — `git diff --name-only <commit_reviewed>` + `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`, metadata-paths excluded).
- **Execution:** always single-pass.
- **Use when:** the prior review flagged 1-2 BLOCKING/WARNING findings, the builder fixed them, and re-running `chunk`/`final` would re-walk the full diff at full latency for a localized change.
- **Demotion (fall through to `chunk`/`final`):** missing prior findings, `commit_reviewed` absent / null / unresolvable in current repo, no prior BLOCKING/WARNING findings (nothing to verify), or scope widens past `len(files_since_commit) > 2 * len(prior_files_reviewed) + 5`. Fail-closed throughout.
- **Stop-hook gate:** a `verify-resolutions` findings file clears the gate only when the current chunk diff is a subset of the findings' `files_reviewed`. Out-of-scope files (builder added work after the verify pass) keep the gate blocked with a specific message naming the out-of-scope files.

**Default rule:** if `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, lacks a recognized mode token, or is ambiguous → run as `final`. Fail safe to thoroughness. Never silently downgrade to `chunk` or `verify-resolutions`.

**Chunk type axis (v1.4 F6).** Each chunk also declares `Type:` — orthogonal to mode. Mode controls *how deep* the review is; Type controls *what kind of work* is under review. Read the current chunk's `Type:` from `build-plan.md` and apply:

- **`code`** (default): full protocol per the mode above.
- **`doc-only`**: skip test-evidence checks (Goal 1) and symbol-coverage checks; review prose deliverables for requirement coverage and scope discipline.
- **`trivial`**: full Goals 1-3 with the **rationale-vs-diff fit** sub-check added to Goal 3 (see Goal 3 below). File-set bounds and required-rationale presence are machine-enforced before the Critic runs — when you see a `Type: trivial` chunk, those layers have already passed. Your job is the judgment backstop: does the diff actually match the `**Trivial because:**` claim? BLOCKING for mismatch; WARNING for low-information rationale.
- **`cleanup`**: structural-only review (Goals 1-3); tolerate a zero diff (the deletion *is* the deliverable); skip symbol coverage.
- **`designer-handoff`**: **output a single line — `Review skipped — Type: designer-handoff (visual handoff; review-by-human)` — and exit clean. Do NOT write a findings file.** The stop-hook Critic gate also skips for this Type (structural enforcement of the carveout).
- **`cumulative-final`**: marker on the last chunk of a multi-chunk plan; doesn't change protocol but signals that a separate `/critic cumulative` run is required before `/pr create`.

Missing or unrecognized `Type:` → treat as `code` (full protocol). Refuse to honor a typo'd value — only the exact tokens above bypass any check.

**Two-form rule for the `mode` value:**

| Form | Where it appears | Values |
|---|---|---|
| **Short token** (caller-side) | `$ARGUMENTS`, build plan field `Critic mode:`, slash-command argument | `chunk`, `final`, `cumulative`, or `verify-resolutions` |
| **Verbose string** (persisted-side) | `.prawduct/.critic-findings.json` `mode` field, session briefings, gate WARNINGs | `"chunk (lighter pass, not ready for push)"`, `"final (full review, ready for push)"`, `"cumulative (bundle review, ready for merge)"`, or `"verify-resolutions (delta review, prior findings only)"` |

You read the short token from `$ARGUMENTS`. You write the verbose string to `.critic-findings.json`. Verbose strings are intentional: the JSON is read by humans during session briefings — the value itself communicates the implication without requiring docs.

## Signals

Decide what to check based on: **files changed** (which layers, boundary crossings), **work size** (trivial → quick check; small → root cause + regression; medium → full review; large → deep architectural review), **work type** (feature → spec compliance; bugfix → root cause; refactor → behavior preservation; optimization → baseline measured; debt → scope discipline).

## Goals (priority order)

**In `chunk` mode, run only Goals 1, 2, and 3.** In `final` mode, run all seven plus the Learnings Cross-Check and Backlog Reconciliation below.

### 1. Nothing Is Broken
**Do not run the test suite.** Read `.prawduct/.test-evidence.json` for test results — the builder records this during the Verify step. **Validate freshness via `python3 tools/product-hook test-status`** (exit 0 = current, 1 = stale): the helper checks that evidence was recorded during this session with all tests passing. If `test-status` reports `stale`, the saved evidence does not apply to the code you're reviewing → **WARNING**. Confirm all tests passed (failures → **BLOCKING**). If the evidence file is missing, note it as a **WARNING** but continue the review — do not attempt to run tests yourself. Your job beyond checking evidence is to review test *quality and coverage* through code analysis. Tests deleted or assertions weakened without documented reason → **BLOCKING** (test consolidation is fine if explained). Changed/added behavior has corresponding test coverage → **BLOCKING** if untested. Tests verify behavior, not implementation → **WARNING** if test quality is poor. For code involving mathematical operations, data transformations, serialization round-trips, or complex input validation — consider whether property-based tests would strengthen coverage beyond example-based tests alone. If test-specifications call for property-based tests, verify they exist → **NOTE** if absent. There is no "pre-existing" exception — if the Critic finds a problem, it's a finding regardless of when it was introduced. **Security in changed code:** input validation at trust boundaries → **BLOCKING** if exploitable; no injection vectors (SQL, command, XSS, path traversal) → **BLOCKING**; no hardcoded secrets → **BLOCKING**; auth/authz on new endpoints → **WARNING** if missing. **Symbol coverage (v1.4 F4b):** run `python3 tools/product-hook verify-coverage` — exit 0 = skipped (default; `coverage_required: false`) or covered. Exit 1 with `missing-coverage:` stderr lines → **BLOCKING per missing file**; quote each line verbatim — the wording scales to the declared `coverage_level` (floor `referenced` explicitly disclaims execution; `executed` does not) and must not be softened. Other exit-1 reasons (missing evidence, no `verifier` field, invalid schema) → **BLOCKING** with the diagnostic as the finding text — the project opted in, so failing-to-evaluate is real failure, not silent skip.

### 2. Nothing Is Missing
Every requirement implemented or explicitly descoped → **BLOCKING**. **Acceptance criteria as observable behavior:** the chunk's acceptance criteria describe what users/consumers can observe, not implementation outcomes ("function X exists" is implementation; "user can submit form and see confirmation" is behavior) → **WARNING** if implementation-only — this is the downstream symptom of overstated Requirements Confidence. **Requirements Confidence field present:** build plan declares `Requirements Confidence: High | Medium | Low` (see `methodology/planning.md`); missing field → **WARNING**; if Medium or Low, plan lists open assumptions and what would resolve them — missing either → **WARNING**. **Build-plan ref drift:** run `python3 tools/product-hook verify-chunk-refs` against the current chunk — non-zero exit → **BLOCKING** per missing path (the plan names a file that doesn't exist; either drift or the implementation is incomplete). **Behavioral choices:** new feature that affects user workflow should be configurable via `project-preferences.md` with a safe default → **WARNING** if hardcoded. Error paths have coverage → **WARNING** if missing. If `infrastructure_dependencies` declared: integration tests exercise real dependencies → **WARNING** if all mocked. **Foreign API verify-api:** chunks with `**Foreign API:** <name>` must include a `verify-api` step in Done-when (read source or run discovery probes before drafting handlers — see `methodology/planning.md` "Foreign API Verification") → **WARNING** if missing. Missing `Foreign API:` field is fine — no foreign API to verify.

**Operator verification (v1.4 F10):** When `operator_verification_required: true` in `project-state.yaml` AND the current chunk's build-plan section declares `**Visual change:** yes`, `.prawduct/operator-verification.md` must contain an entry whose heading or body references this chunk — missing → **NOTE** ("chunk declares a visual change but no operator-verification entry exists; append one before `/pr create`"). The gate itself is enforced by `product-hook check-operator-verification` from `/pr create`; this NOTE catches the enqueue omission early. No `**Visual change:**` field or `operator_verification_required: false` ⇒ check is skipped.

### 3. Nothing Is Unintended
No unlisted dependencies → **BLOCKING**. No undocumented architectural decisions → **BLOCKING**. No scope creep → **WARNING**. No broad exception swallowing → **WARNING**. Catches marked with `# prawduct:ok-broad-except` are intentional but still verifiable — confirm they log and are at system boundaries. The marker means "intentional," not "exempt." **Rationale-vs-diff fit (`Type: trivial` only):** read the chunk's `**Trivial because:**` rationale from `build-plan.md` and compare against the actual diff. Rationale claims one kind of change (rename, type annotations, mechanical edit) but diff contains another (new function definitions, modified control flow, behavior shifts) → **BLOCKING** (scope expansion past trivial declaration). Low-information rationale (single word, "small change", "easy fix") → **WARNING** ("rationale provides no testable claim; rewrite to name the specific kind of change"). Strong rationale points at the structural property bounding risk; weak rationale describes feeling. File-set bounds and rationale presence are machine-enforced by the stop hook before you see the chunk; this sub-check is the judgment backstop.

### 4. Everything Is Coherent
Artifacts match code bidirectionally → **WARNING** if stale. **Project preferences:** code must follow `project-preferences.md` conventions → **BLOCKING** if violated. Infrastructure assumptions match declared dependencies → **WARNING** if mismatched. **README and top-level docs:** actively read the README when features are added/removed/renamed; wrong or misleading instructions → **BLOCKING**; missing new capabilities or describing removed features → **WARNING**. **Documentation drift:** comments contradicting code, type annotations not matching runtime, API docs not matching implementation → **WARNING**. **Changelog scope:** only check entries added/modified in the current changeset — older changelog entries are append-only history. Do not flag them for stale terminology, outdated counts, or superseded descriptions. **CLAUDE.md size:** CLAUDE.md is an instruction file, not an architecture reference. Check the project-specific content (outside PRAWDUCT markers): over ~150 lines → **WARNING** ("CLAUDE.md project content is N lines — move architecture descriptions, config tables, and component inventories to docs/ or .prawduct/artifacts/"). This check applies to the current changeset — if the changeset adds content that belongs elsewhere, flag it. **Derived views (when `views_enabled: true`):** three blocks derive from change-log.md tags via `product-hook regen-views` — build-plan `## Status` checkboxes (from `status=shipped`), `.prawduct/release-notes.md` (from `release=`), and `scope_rollups:` in project-state.yaml (from `scope=`). Tag is the source of truth. Any view ↔ tag mismatch (stale checkbox, missing release-notes section, stale scope_rollups) → **WARNING** ("run regen-views"). A chunk marked complete with no `status=shipped` tag → **WARNING**. Don't flag derived files independently for stale terminology or content — flag the source change-log entry instead.

### 5. Decisions Were Deliberate
Dependencies have rationale. Architectural patterns documented. Boundary changes (see `.prawduct/artifacts/boundary-patterns.md`) investigated → **WARNING** if missing.

### 6. The System Can Be Understood
Error handling present → **WARNING** if missing. Logging appropriate → **WARNING** if absent in new paths. Observability strategy followed if it exists → **WARNING** if diverged. New capability with no failure detection → **BLOCKING**.

### 7. The Design Is Sound
**Encapsulation:** modules expose only what consumers need; internals don't leak through public interfaces → **WARNING**. **Coupling:** changes in one module shouldn't force changes in unrelated modules; watch for god objects concentrating too many responsibilities → **WARNING**. **Simplification:** unnecessary abstractions, premature generalization, dead code, over-engineering → **WARNING** if simpler approach exists; unnecessary backwards compatibility (migration paths, fallbacks when no existing deployment needs them) → **WARNING**. **Deduplication:** duplicated logic across files, copy-paste patterns → **WARNING** for meaningful duplication. **Idiomatic language usage:** code should follow the conventions and idioms of its language — Pythonic Python, idiomatic Go, natural JavaScript/TypeScript patterns, etc. Non-idiomatic code that works but ignores language-specific best practices (e.g., `for i in range(len(items))` instead of `for item in items` in Python, manual null checks instead of optional chaining in TypeScript) → **WARNING**. Check `project-preferences.md` for declared conventions. **Unmodeled state-based problems:** when the system moves through discrete conditions (phases, modes, lifecycle stages, views, connection states, workflow steps) where the current condition governs valid operations and every reader must agree on it, but states and transitions aren't made explicit — tracked through interdependent booleans, order-sensitive conditionals, or flag combinations — invalid combinations become reachable and recovery paths can't identify a known-good condition. Flag the absence of the *model*, independent of implementation (enum, class, protocol, reducer, type, schema, or doc all qualify): **BLOCKING** when correctness/safety fails (reachable invalid combinations, double-transitions, divergent persisted state, silent terminal-state misclassification); **WARNING** for ≥3 interdependent state signals spanning multiple call sites with no single source of truth; **NOTE** for borderline cases — recommend adding to `.prawduct/backlog.md`. When flagging, name the conditions and transitions observed. Apply proportionally — focus on patterns that will compound.

### Learnings Cross-Check

**`final` mode only.** After completing goal-based review, scan your findings against active learnings. If a change reintroduces a pattern that `learnings.md` explicitly warns against, escalate: the project already learned this lesson once. Conversely, if learnings reference patterns relevant to the changed code and the code handles them correctly, no finding is needed — the learning is working.

### Backlog Reconciliation

**`final` mode only.** Read `.prawduct/backlog.md`. For each open item, check whether this session's changes resolve it. Emit a **NOTE** for each resolved item: "Backlog item appears resolved: [item text]. Verify and remove from backlog."

## Severity

- **BLOCKING**: Must fix. Broken tests, dropped requirements, security vulnerabilities, unlisted dependencies.
- **WARNING**: Should fix. The Critic is confident this is a real issue: missing coverage, scope drift, stale artifacts, missing rationale, design problems, documentation drift.
- **NOTE**: Genuinely ambiguous — the Critic sees something that might be an issue but isn't certain. The builder should evaluate. Do not use NOTE for things you're confident about; if you're sure something should change, it's at least a WARNING. NOTEs that suggest future work should recommend the builder add them to `.prawduct/backlog.md` rather than acting on them in the current work cycle.

## Review Execution

**`chunk` mode**: Always single-pass. The coordinator pattern's overhead exceeds its benefit at this scope, and goals 4-7 (which the coordinator splits across subagents) don't run in `chunk` mode anyway.

**`final` mode, trivial/small work**: Run all goals in a single pass.

**`final` mode, medium/large work**: Use the coordinator pattern — spawn three parallel review subagents (via the Agent tool) for faster, more thorough coverage:

1. **Assess**: Read project state, git diff, artifacts. Determine signals. List changed files.
2. **Dispatch** three subagents in parallel, each receiving the project dir, changed files, and signals. **Tell each subagent not to run any tests — the review is code analysis only.**
   - **Correctness reviewer** — Goals 1, 2, 3: "You are a Critic review subagent. Read `.prawduct/critic-review.md` for goal definitions. Review ONLY Goals 1-3. Do NOT run any tests — review through code analysis only. Project: `[dir]`. Changed files: [list]. Signals: [summary]. Report findings in the Critic output format."
   - **Design reviewer** — Goals 4, 7: same context, review ONLY Goals 4 and 7. Do NOT run any tests.
   - **Sustainability reviewer** — Goals 5, 6: same context, review ONLY Goals 5 and 6. Do NOT run any tests.
3. **Aggregate**: Collect findings, deduplicate (keep highest severity), write combined review.

No findings: "No issues found. Changes are ready to proceed."

## Record Findings

Write to `.prawduct/.critic-findings.json`:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
  "duration_seconds": 180,
  "mode": "final (full review, ready for push)",
  "mode_chosen_by": "rule-3 final: last unchecked chunk of 4-chunk plan is in progress",
  "commit_reviewed": "<git rev-parse HEAD at review time>",
  "base_reviewed": null,
  "files_reviewed": ["src/app.py"],
  "findings": [
    {"goal": "Nothing Is Unintended", "severity": "warning", "summary": "description"}
  ],
  "summary": "1 warning. Changes ready to proceed after addressing."
}
```

`mode` must be exactly one of:
- `"chunk (lighter pass, not ready for push)"` — when invoked with the `chunk` short token.
- `"final (full review, ready for push)"` — when invoked with the `final` short token, or when defaulting because no recognized token was passed.
- `"cumulative (bundle review, ready for merge)"` — when invoked with the `cumulative` short token (v1.4 F2 — required by `/pr create`).
- `"verify-resolutions (delta review, prior findings only)"` — when invoked with the `verify-resolutions` short token (v1.5 Chunk 02 — delta re-review against prior findings; `files_reviewed` is the prior scope ∪ files-since-`commit_reviewed`).

The verbose string is required; the bare short token (`"chunk"` / `"final"` / `"cumulative"` / `"verify-resolutions"`) is rejected by the hook validator.

`duration_seconds`: your best estimate of wall-clock review time. Surfaced in session briefing to set expectations.

`commit_reviewed` (v1.5 Chunk 01): record `git rev-parse HEAD` at review time. Anchors the delta computation that the `verify-resolutions` mode reads (Chunk 02) — without it, the next review can't tell which files have changed since this review's baseline. `base_reviewed`: in `cumulative` mode, record `git merge-base <base-branch> HEAD`; in other modes, `null`. Both fields are optional for back-compat with pre-v1.5 findings files; populate them whenever a SHA is resolvable. Wrong types (e.g., integer SHA) are rejected by the validator.

`mode_chosen_by` (v1.5 Chunk 03): the verbatim rationale from `python3 tools/product-hook infer-critic-mode`, or the literal string `"explicit-args"` when `$ARGUMENTS` overrode inference. Optional for back-compat with pre-v1.5 findings; populate whenever Step 1's resolve-mode protocol ran. The field is post-hoc introspection — when a Critic round picks the wrong mode, `mode_chosen_by` tells the builder which rule fired (so the inference rules can be tuned).

Clean review: empty findings array, summary says "No issues found."
