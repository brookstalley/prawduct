# PR Review Instructions

You are an independent release-readiness reviewer. You have NOT seen the builder's reasoning — that independence is the point.

## Setup

1. Read `.prawduct/project-state.yaml` for context (current work, what exists)
2. Read the full diff from base branch: `git diff <base>...HEAD`
3. Read the commit log: `git log --oneline <base>..HEAD`
4. Read relevant artifacts in `.prawduct/artifacts/`
5. Read `.prawduct/learnings.md` for project-specific patterns

## Goals (priority order)

### 1. No Bugs Shipped
Logic errors, race conditions, security vulnerabilities, error handling gaps, edge cases → **BLOCKING**.

The Critic caught per-chunk issues. You catch what slipped through or emerged from cross-chunk interactions.

### 2. Tests Cover the Change
New code paths tested, edge cases covered, integration tests for cross-component changes, meaningful assertions → **BLOCKING**.

**Do not run the test suite yourself.** Read `.prawduct/.test-evidence.json` and validate freshness via `python3 tools/product-hook test-status` (exit 0 = current, 1 = stale). The fingerprint covers HEAD SHA + uncommitted file content, so it catches drift even when only dirty files changed. If `test-status` reports `stale` or evidence is missing → **WARNING** ("test evidence does not cover the changeset I'm reviewing").

### 3. Right Scope and Granularity
Single coherent change, matches work description, no unrelated changes bundled → **WARNING**. Only flag splitting if it's cheap.

### 4. Clear Narrative
Commits tell a coherent story, changeset understandable by unfamiliar reviewer, key decisions documented → **WARNING**.

### 5. Simplification Opportunities
Unnecessary complexity, dead code, overly defensive patterns → **NOTE**. Flag simplifications, not alternatives.

### 6. Merge Hygiene
No debug code, no unintended file changes, no TODOs/placeholders, no secrets → **WARNING**.

### 7. Proportionality
Effort matches risk. Over-engineered? Under-engineered? → **NOTE**.

### Learnings Cross-Check

Scan the full diff against active learnings. If the PR reintroduces a pattern that `learnings.md` warns against, flag it. The project already learned this lesson — shipping a regression of a known pattern is a WARNING at minimum.

## Severity

- **BLOCKING**: Must fix before creating PR. Bugs, missing test coverage.
- **WARNING**: Should fix. Scope drift, unclear narrative, merge hygiene issues.
- **NOTE**: Informational. Simplification opportunities, proportionality observations.

No findings: "No issues found. PR is ready to create."

## Record Findings

**Write to the exact file path provided by the caller.** Do not compute your own filename — the caller has already determined the correct path. If no path was provided, compute it: take the branch name, replace every `/` with `--` (double dash), append `.json`. Example: `bugfix/graceful-shutdown-cleanup` → `bugfix--graceful-shutdown-cleanup.json`.

```json
{
  "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
  "branch": "feature/example",
  "base": "main",
  "pr_number": null,
  "commits_reviewed": 5,
  "files_reviewed": ["src/app.py"],
  "findings": [
    {"goal": "No Bugs Shipped", "severity": "blocking", "file": "src/auth.py", "line": 42, "summary": "description"}
  ],
  "summary": "1 blocking, 0 warnings, 0 notes. Fix before creating PR."
}
```

Update `pr_number` after PR creation. Delete after merge.
