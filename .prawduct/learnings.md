# Learnings

Active rules from this project's development. Surfaced via the `/learnings [topic]` skill — topic headers shown in the session briefing for ambient context. Entries use "When X, do Y because Z" format. Each entry's full narrative lives in `learnings-detail.md` under the same heading — keep narrative THERE, not here.

---

## When compacting or migrating a file that tooling parses, classify every span by its CONSUMER before moving it — machine-read metadata (a parsed comment, a `sentinel=` tag, a status marker) is not "narrative" and must stay where its reader looks, because a content-loss guard that only proves "prose is preserved elsewhere" is blind to metadata it silently relocates or drops

## When a session finds uncommitted work in a worktree it did NOT launch in, treat it as another session's territory and leave it alone — a session works only in its own worktree, because sibling WIP belongs to a possibly-live session and adopting it collides with that work and writes into the clone-shared governance state

## When surfacing a batch of model-proposed candidates for owner confirm-or-correct (norm ratification, backlog reconcile, findings triage), triage by decision-worthiness FIRST — surface the few that carry a real fork individually, bulk-confirm the obvious rest, never a flat dump — because a flat list at scale buries the real decisions and trains the owner to rubber-stamp, defeating the review it exists to be

## When writing a durable artifact (code comment, docstring, long-lived spec), never anchor its meaning to an ephemeral build identifier — carry the *why* inline, because build plans are deleted after completion and every project has many "chunk 03"s

## When `check-cumulative-critic` reports `uncovered` on a branch whose code you know was reviewed, suspect a stale base before running a fresh review — the gate anchors to `origin/<base>` by design, so unpushed integration commits drag already-shipped work into the required span

## When developing requirements to replace a working system, sweep every consumer's actual usage before finalizing — reported pain is a hypothesis, and the loudest complaint is often not the deepest failure

## When a fail-closed validator guards a model-written field, tolerate the natural encoding variant — reserve the hard fail for genuine ambiguity, because incidental strictness at a model-output seam is a latent fail-close

## When designing any flow step that records status or bookkeeping, make it ride IN the PR that does the work — a step that can only run post-merge on the integration branch is structurally broken for protected-branch consumers

## When a governance checkpoint verifies a required side-effect happened, put it OUTSIDE the control flow that produces the side-effect — a check inside the fallible flow can't catch that flow's own skip

## When building from a review/audit artifact, verify each cited gap and fix-instruction against HEAD before planning — the artifact's file-state claims aged the moment it was written

## When you add an ingest/IO surface to a platform-agnostic framework, expose the minimal data primitive — not one ecosystem's file format — or you silently lock out the toolchains the agnosticism promised

## When a build plan ships in a different release than it targeted, its frontmatter `scope:` must be the scope-NAME (not a version) — `regen-views` resolves plans by it and a version there silently skips Status flipping at release

## When serially merging several stale feature branches into develop for one batched release, expect additive bookkeeping conflicts every time — and watch for a duplicate `active_build_plan:` key the auto-merge creates

## When a session switches branches after SessionStart, pass the Critic mode explicitly — `infer-critic-mode` trusts the stale session-start branch marker

## When prose picks which model a reviewer/subagent runs on, express it as an ordered fallback chain resolved at dispatch — never a pinned alias

## When you disable a mechanism at its wiring point but keep its implementation, reconcile the retained code's self-descriptions in the same change — or its prose reads as false

## When verifying a framework-repo `lib/`/`bin/` change by running the hook, invoke the repo-local `python3 bin/prawduct-hook` — the bare `prawduct-hook` on PATH is the installed plugin cache, not your working tree

## After a clean cumulative (0 blocking/0 warning), NOTEs are advisory — don't chase cosmetic ones; fixing them reopens the coverage gate on judgeable governance files and forces a no-value review pass

## A new build plan with `scope: null` and low chunk numbers inherits another scope's shipped checkbox flips — set `scope:` from the start

## New change-log entries on a feature branch are statusless — `status=in-progress` is deprecated and trips the regen-views typo-guard

## A change-log `chunks=` tag must match the build plan's chunk-heading numbering *exactly* (zero-padding included) or `regen-views` flips only the matching chunks

## When a feature's logic lives in a `context:fork` skill (no Bash), `lib/` holds the DATA, not the LOGIC — logic helpers nothing imports are dead code

## At release, flip *statusless* unreleased change-log entries to `status=shipped` too — not just `status=merged`

## "I'm just codifying their guidance" is not an exemption from the research trigger — and volatility is a separate axis from knowledge-confidence

## The "canonical" mechanism for a capability can be disqualified by a plugin's composability + always-on constraints — verify the constraint before adopting the recommendation

## When a fan-out render keys on a field that isn't unique, test the collision case — and a self-authored adversarial pass inherits the author's blind spots

## When fanning out a batch build to parallel worktree-isolated workflow agents, partition by disjoint file ownership (integrator owns shared files) and force-clean leftover worktrees before the integration suite

## When a fresh-eyes review's advice about a CONVENTION conflicts with a durable learning + the process doc, the documented convention wins — re-verify before acting

## A reviewer's NOTE/severity is a prior, not a verdict — re-scope any "harmless" change that touches a governance-gate input

## A new framework-wide DEFAULT must land in the session digest — place-once preferences and the thin anchor don't reach migrated repos

## Single-repo plugin+marketplace: the marketplace entry's plugin `source` must be `"./"`, not `{source:github,ref}`

## Release-bound work merged feature→develop under gitflow: KEEP the build plan — it's a live release artifact, not spent

## A `--plugin-dir` read-block is a dev-flag artifact, not a self-containment bug — pair it with `--add-dir`

## Test subprocesses: HOME=tmp_path leaks Python's pyc cache into the test repo

## "Structurally enforced" requires verifying the harness actually enforces it

## Tool-restricted reviewer agents must be context:fork SKILLS, not named plugin subagents

## When a deliberate change turns a passing test red, renegotiate the contract in the open

## A behavior change isn't done until every artifact that DESCRIBES it is updated

## A decision reversed mid-chunk leaves stale rationale in prose you just wrote

## Editing a runtime that governs the current session: check your own signals first

## Pre-dispatch bootstrap code must fail open on a `lib/` ImportError

## Session-end signals must come AFTER handoff

## Artifacts drift silently during sustained building

## Structural gates must match natural workflow

## Growing files need structural nudges to prune

## Reactive systems can't detect missing things

## Governance complexity breeds governance complexity

## Principles need runtime enforcement, not just change-time checks

## Denormalized state drifts without mechanical validation

## Coherence cascades require checking summaries, not just primary locations

## Escape hatches in classification create silent failures

## Cumulative-Critic finds first-use regressions chunk-Critic can't

## Auto-enable belongs with visibility, not with enforcement

## Removing a mechanism requires removing its name too

## Build-plan fields use `**Title Case:**`, not snake_case

## Build-plan chunk headings must use `### Chunk N:` colon form — em-dash fails the parsers silently

## Submodule and same-name function in __init__ shadow each other

## Detection of structural characteristics should not rely on mechanistic surface markers

## Shared "answer" state and personal "nag" state belong in separate stores

## Framework ownership follows the write strategy, not just registry membership

## A leftover marker is not an in-progress signal — and a test using the canonical marker leaves the real-world branch untested

## A near-verbatim file PORT carries the source's prose — adapt the docs, not just the logic

## A subagent's reported COUNT or LIST is a lead, not ground truth — verify before a blanket edit

## Verify the platform's copy/packaging boundary before duplicating a shared bundled file — a prior "duplicate into each consumer" choice may be an unverified-constraint workaround

## A plugin skill with unparseable YAML frontmatter loads with ALL metadata silently dropped — validate it in CI

## Dogfooding the generator on its own output masks output-relative bugs the real consumer would hit

## Relocating a source file: sweep every READER of the old path, not just the data-key references

## A review's "inert / harmless" verdict on a latent bug is conditional on the current call graph

## Excising a subsystem silently kills the incidental work it happened to host — re-home the orphaned call, and test the positive

## A "renders-but-doesn't-resolve" leak is a SURFACE, not a line — sweep the whole renderer and assert the bad form is ABSENT

## An "assert the bad form is ABSENT" sweep is only as good as the pattern that defines the bad form — enumerate the whole FORM-FAMILY, not one spelling

## An untested governance bound rots silently across a migration — sweep the guards (with tests), not just the prose

## In a leaf-first decomposition, dependency-scan a chunk's COMMAND bodies against later-chunk symbols before moving — and never move a parity-pinned mirror just because a deliverable lists it

## A format's schema legend lives in `templates/` (scaffold-only) — adding an optional field reaches already-onboarded repos only via a migrate/triage *refresh* step, not the template

## A structural bound that ENFORCES a declaration is not a DETECTOR of the declared property — reusing it at a new boundary silently drops its justification

## A rebuild scoped to a subsystem's "remaining / deferred" parts silently omits an already-shipped part that was deleted in between — re-port against the spec roster, not the open-work list

## A persisted schema's requirements are its consumers' future queries — lock-in is reversal cost, not LOC, so "small format" never exempts it from decision research

## Test-evidence freshness is `test-status` (session timestamp) ONLY — `git_sha` was retired as misleading (TST-4K2P)

## A cross-cutting concern can be UNCOVERED even when discovery names it once — audit the coverage matrix for "named-but-dropped", not just "absent"

## When generalizing or detecting "across all cases", the COMMON / AVAILABLE instance silently narrows the requirement to itself — check coverage against the requirement's stated breadth

## Before "fixing" an apparent forgotten-manual-update, check whether the artifact is a GENERATED / DERIVED view — the real fix is upstream

## A test asserting the framework repo's OWN state instead of the propagated contract gives false coverage — assert the contract that reaches consumer repos

## When a plan sets a quantitative reduction/size floor over a corpus you cannot shrink by dropping content, derive the floor from a per-file compressibility sample — not a global intuition

## Never chain a test-evidence `record` after a suite run in the same command, and never read a piped suite's exit code — read the run's own summary first, because a false-green record pollutes the gate exactly like a false-red

## Re-attempting a mechanism rejected for a false-positive class: make it ADDITIVE and relax-only, and separate the framing from the primitive

## A proactive nudge narrowed to pass a "zero-fire against this repo" acceptance criterion suppresses the exact signal on the reference repo — check the repo is genuinely OUT of the target state before muting

## For a coverage / forcing-function opt-out, make the resolution a first-class recorded artifact (even a one-line stub), not a suppression flag

## A repo-coupled (non-hermetic) test turns every "non-judgeable" doc/state change into a silent test-breaker — the doc-only and test-status classifiers assume non-code files can't change test outcomes
