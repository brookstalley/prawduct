## 2026-04-03: Stop tracking test counts as static artifacts (v1.3.2)

**Why:** Test count is derived data — it changes every time a test is added or removed. Storing it in static artifacts (project-state.yaml, CLAUDE.md, learnings.md) creates constant reconciliation work: the Critic flags discrepancies, and developers spend real time updating numbers that have no value over the hook's dynamic count.

**Changes:**
- Removed "test counts" from the artifact-update guidance in `methodology/building.md` and `build-governance.md` (template + instance)
- Removed "test counts" from the Critic's bidirectional freshness check (`agents/critic/SKILL.md`)
- Removed "update test count" from the janitor's task list (`.claude/skills/janitor/SKILL.md`)
- Removed `build_state.test_tracking` from the framework's own `project-state.yaml`
- Added `strip_test_tracking()` migration step to `tools/lib/migrate_cmd.py` — removes stale `test_tracking` from existing product repos on next migrate/sync

## 2026-04-01: Embed Critic review in build plan chunks (v1.3.1)

**Why:** Critic review was being skipped or offered as optional despite explicit behavioral instructions in CLAUDE.md. Behavioral instructions degrade under context pressure; the build plan — which Claude actively follows step by step — had no Critic step at all.

**Changes:**
- Build plan template: each chunk now has "Done when" steps (acceptance + `/critic` + commit)
- Removed "do not ask, do not offer" behavioral instructions from CLAUDE.md, product-claude.md, build-governance.md
- Replaced with plan-following instruction: "Follow the plan — the Critic step is there"
- Stop hook blocker message now references the build plan's "Done when" steps
- Build governance step 9 ties chunk `[x]` marking to "Done when" completion

## 2026-03-30: Extracted lib modules, framework version tracking, reflection gate improvements (v1.3.0)

**Why:** The monolithic setup script was difficult to test and maintain. Framework version tracking was needed so product repos can detect when they're out of sync. The mandatory reflection gate was blocking exploratory/Q&A sessions that had no build work to reflect on.

**Changes:**
- Extracted `tools/lib/` modules (core, init, migrate, sync, validate) from monolithic setup script
- Framework version tracking — sync records `framework_version` in manifest; session start warns if `../prawduct` is stale relative to last sync
- Reflection gate is now advisory (not blocking) when no build plan is active — exploratory/Q&A sessions no longer require mandatory reflection
- Comprehensive test coverage for all user onboarding journeys (750 tests)
- V4_GITIGNORE_ENTRIES now matches GITIGNORE_ENTRIES (adds `.session-handoff.md`, `.test-evidence.json`, `.pr-reviews/`)
- Critic changelog scope — only checks entries from current changeset, not historical entries
- Gitignore hygiene — sync removes managed files from .gitignore if incorrectly added
- Deprecation warnings when migrating v1/v3/partial repos

**Classification:** structural

## 2026-03-28: Structural Critic tool restrictions, test evidence, and auto-invocation (v1.2.9)

**Why:** The Critic repeatedly ran the full test suite (10K+ tests) despite instructions not to — behavioral constraints lose to safety goals when the agent has unrestricted Bash access. Additionally, builders treated Critic review as optional, offering it as a user choice rather than running it automatically.

**Changes:**
- Critic is now a proper Claude Code skill (`.claude/skills/critic/SKILL.md`) with `allowed-tools` that structurally prevent running tests, builds, or executables. Uses `context: fork` for independent review.
- Test evidence mechanism: builder records results to `.prawduct/.test-evidence.json` during Verify; Critic reads evidence instead of re-running tests.
- Strengthened Critic invocation language: "Run `/critic` now — do not ask the user, do not offer it as an option."
- Stop hook skips reflection gate for doc-only (.md) changes.

**Classification:** governance

## 2026-03-22: Make project-state.yaml merge-friendly

**Why:** Multiple agents/developers working in parallel branches frequently conflict on project-state.yaml. Agents resolve by taking "ours," losing other branches' progress.

**Changes:** Branch-scoped WIP (keyed by git branch name), change_log split to separate .prawduct/change-log.md, test_count computed instead of tracked, merge conflict guidance added.

**Classification:** structural

## 2026-03-22: Consolidate init/migrate/sync into unified prawduct-setup.py

**Why:** Three scripts with importlib cross-imports, a 6-step prose detection algorithm in CLAUDE.md, no post-setup validation, and no health check tool.

**Changes:** Unified into one script with subcommands (setup, sync, validate). Added /prawduct-setup skill. Old scripts replaced with import-safe backward-compat shims. 725 total tests.

**Classification:** structural
